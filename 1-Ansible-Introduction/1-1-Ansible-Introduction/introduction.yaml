 In this lecture, we will get introduced
to what Ansible is.
If you're a systems engineer or IT administrator
or just anybody working in IT,
you're probably involved in doing a lot
of repetitive tasks in your environment,
whether it be sizing and creating new hosts
or virtual machines every day,
applying configurations on them,
patching in hundreds of servers, migrations,
deploying applications, or even performing security
and compliance audits.

All of these very repetitive tasks involve execution
of hundreds of commands on hundreds of different servers
while maintaining the right sequence of events
with system reboots and whatnot in between.
Some people develop scripts to automate these tasks
but that requires coding skills and regular maintenance
of these scripts, and a lot of time
to put these scripts together on the first place.
That's where Ansible helps.

Ansible is a powerful IT automation tool
that you can learn quickly.
It's simple enough for everyone in IT,
yet powerful enough to automate
even the most complex deployments.
In the past, something that took developing
a complex script, now takes just a few lines
of instruction in an Ansible automation playbook.
Whether you want to make that happen on your local host
or on all of your database servers
or all of your web servers on cloud or just the ones
on your DR environment, all it takes is modifying one line.

Now, don't worry about the playbook itself
or its syntax for now.
We will get into that in a bit,
and we have lots of fun exercises coming up
that will get you all set with this in no time.

Let's take a look at a simple use case.
Imagine you have a number of hosts in your environment
that you would like to restart in a particular order.
Some of them are web servers and others are database servers
so you would like to power down the web servers first,
followed by the database servers, and then power up
the database servers and then the web servers.
You could write an Ansible playbook to get this done
in a matter of minutes and simply invoke
the Ansible playbook every time you wish to restart
your application.

Let's take a look at another example.
In this case, we are setting up a complex infrastructure
that spans across public and private clouds
and that includes hundreds of VMs.
With Ansible, you could provision VMs on public clouds
like Amazon and as well as private cloud environments
like VMware, and move on to configuring applications
on those and setting up communication between them,
such as modifying configuration files,
installing applications on them,
configuring firewall rules, et cetera.
There are a lot of built-in modules available
in Ansible that supports these kind of operations.
You can easily integrate Ansible with the rest
of your environment so that you can pull information
to be used in the automation process,
such as data from a CMDB database
to get the list of VMs you wanna target
or you can configure Ansible
to trigger automation automatically when from tools
like ServiceNow, when a workflow gets approved.

The Ansible documentation pages hosted at docs.ansible.com
are comprehensive and contains all information required
to get started with Ansible, and there are hundreds
of examples of playbooks in these pages.
We will be referring to these while setting up
and installing Ansible.
So that's a quick introduction to what Ansible is,
why you might want to consider it and what it can do.
