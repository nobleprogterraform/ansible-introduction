In this lecture, we take a look at what YAML files are.
All Ansible Playbooks are written in YAML.
I would recommend going through this
because the rest of the course depends entirely on YAML.

Ansible Playbooks are text files
or configuration files rather,
that are written in a particular format called YAML.
If you have worked with other data structure formats
like XML or JSON, you should be able to easily pick it up.


A YAML file is used to represent data,
in this case, configuration data.
Here is a quick comparison of a sample data in three different formats.
The one on the left is XML where we display a list of servers and their information.
The same data is represented in JSON format in the middle and finally in YAML format to the right.
Let's take a close look at YAML.

this is how you would define it in YAML. Key and value separated by a colon.

Let's take a look at how an array is represented.We would like to list some fruits and vegetables.
We would say fruits followed by a colon.
On the next line, enter each item with a dash in the front.
The dash indicates that it's an element of an array.

How about a dictionary?
A dictionary is a set of properties grouped together under an item.
Here, we try to represent nutrition information of two fruits.
The calories, fat, and carbs are different for each fruit.
Notice the blank space before each item. You must have equal number of blank spaces
before the properties of a single item
so they are all aligned together.


Dictionary is an unordered collection whereas lists are ordered collection.
So what does that mean?
The two dictionaries that you see here have the same properties for banana.
However, you can see that the order of properties
fat and carbs do not match.

The properties can be defined in any order,
but the two dictionaries will still be the same
as long as the values of each property match.
This is not the same for lists or arrays.
Arrays are ordered collection,
so the order of items matter.
The two lists shown are not the same

Also remember, any line beginning
with a hash is automatically ignored
and considered as a comment.
