Imagine you're an IT administrator
in a large organization with a complex IT infrastructure.
You have hundreds of servers,
spread across multiple locations,
serving different purposes.
Some are web servers, some are database servers,
and others could be application servers.
Managing these servers individually can be a daunting task.

For instance, if you need to update the web servers,
you would have to manually specify each web server.
This is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors.

In managing a complex IT infrastructure,
wouldn't it be convenient if we could categorize servers
based on their roles, locations, or any other criteria
that makes sense in our environment?

For instance, imagine if we could collectively
identify all our web servers under a common label,
say web servers.
This would mean that when an update is needed
for the web servers, instead of manually specifying
each server, we could simply target the web servers label.
The changes would then be applied to all servers
associated with that label, saving us time
and reducing the risk of errors.
This is not just a hypothetical scenario.
This is precisely where Ansible's grouping feature
comes into play.

With Ansible's grouping, we can create these common labels
or groups to efficiently manage and operate
on a set of servers at one.
Now, when you need to update the web servers,
you can simply target the web servers group
and Ansible will apply the changes
to all servers in that group.

But what if your web servers
are spread across different locations
and servers in each location
need to have some location-specific configurations?
You could create separate groups for web servers
in each location but that would mean duplicating
a lot of common configurations.
This is where Ansible's parent-to-child
relationships come in handy.

You can create a parent group called web servers
and child groups for each location, for example,
web servers US, web servers EU, et cetera.
You can define the common configurations
at the parent group level
and location-specific configurations
at the child group level.
This way you can manage your servers more efficiently
and avoid configuration duplication.

In the INI format, groups are defined using square brackets
and hosts are listed under their respective groups.
Parent-child relationships are defined
using the :children suffix.

In this example, web servers US and web servers EU
are groups and web servers is a parent group
that includes both web servers US
and web servers EU as child groups.

In the YAML format, groups are defined
using the keyword hosts and parent-child relationships
are defined using the keyword children.
This is the same example presented in YAML format
for better readability and understanding.
