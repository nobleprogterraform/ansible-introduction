Ansible supports two main types of inventory formats,
INI and YAML.
INI format is the simplest and most straightforward.
It's like a basic organizational chart for a small startup.
Here's an example.
The YAML format is more structured and flexible
than the INI format.
It's like a complex organizational chart
for a multinational corporation.
Here's an example.
Just like a company chooses the right organizational chart
for its operations, you should choose the inventory format
that best suits your project's needs and complexity.
Whether you choose the INI or YAML format,
the key is to ensure your servers, departments
work together to achieve your organizational objectives.

For the small startup,
a simple INI format inventory would suffice.
It's like a basic organizational chart
with only a few departments.
However, for the multinational corporation,
a more detailed and structured inventory would be needed.
This is where the YAML format comes in.
It's like a complex organizational chart
with various departments, sub-departments, and teams.
The different inventory formats also offer flexibility,
allowing you to group your servers based on their roles,
like web servers, database servers,
and application servers in a company,
their geographic location,
like servers in the U.S., Europe, or Asia,
or any other criteria
that makes sense for your organization
