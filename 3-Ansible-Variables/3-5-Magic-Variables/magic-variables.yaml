This lecture, we will discuss
about magic variables in Ansible.
Earlier, we discussed the scope of a variable.
We learned that the host variables
are associated to each host.
With this inventory file,
we have a DNS server specified for host web2.
When Ansible playbook starts,
it first creates three sub-processes for each host.
Before the tasks are run on each host,
Ansible goes through a variable interpolation stage
where it picks up variables from different sources
and associates them to the respective hosts.
Each variable is only associated to the host
on which it was defined, so it is unavailable on the others.
The DNS server's IP address is unavailable on web1
and web3, but how do you get it if you really want it?
How can one Ansible subprocess running tasks
for one host get the variables defined on another host?
How can web1 and web3 get the DNS server's IP address,
which is specified on web2?
That's where we use magic variables.
A magic variable called hostvars can be used
to get variables defined on another host.
In this case, hostvars of web2.dns_server
will get you the DNS server defined on the web2 node,
and this will work for all hosts.
You can get any information about the other hosts this way.
To get the host name or IP of the other host,
use the ansible_host parameter.
If facts are gathered, you can access additional facts
about other hosts, such as their architecture,
information regarding their devices, mounts,
processors, et cetera.
Anything within the facts of a host
can be retrieved like this.
Also, note that you can write the same expression
like this using brackets and single quotes.

So that was one kind of magic variable that are used
to get variables from other hosts.
Another magic variable is called groups.
Groups return all hosts under a given group.
Group names is the other way around.
It returns all the groups the current host is part of.
In this case, when you use group names in a play
for host web1, it returns web_servers
and Americas, which happens to be the groups
that this particular host is part of.
Inventory_hostname is a magic variable
that gives you the name configured for the host
in the inventory file and not the host name or SQDN.
Well, those are a few, and there are others as well
that we can see in the documentation page.
