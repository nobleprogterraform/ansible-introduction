In previous lab we Discussed about variables
So what is variable precedence?
What if you have a variable defined in two different places?
For example, in this inventory file,
I have a variable defined for each host as their IP address.
The ansible_host is a host variable.
I have the host part of a group called Web Servers.
I know that all of my hosts in this group
are to be configured with the same DNS server,
so I set up a group variable called dns_server
with the IP of the server.
Now, when the Ansible playbook is run,
Ansible creates these host objects in its memory.
It then identifies which group each host belongs to
and then associates the group variables to each host.
Each host gets its own copy of that variable
and that is used throughout the playbook execution.
What if I define the same variable on the host as well?
For localhost, I say the DNS server is something else.
Which one would be considered by Ansible?
When Ansible playbook is run, it first associates
the group variables and then associates the host variables.
And so the variable defined at the host level
takes precedence over the variable defined
at the group level, and that's variable precedence.
Host variables takes precedent over group variables.
What about variables defined within a playbook?
Say, for example, inside my playbook that configures
the DNS server, I have defined a variable
with a different value for DNS server.
I have the same variable defined at the group level,
host level, and at the play level.
In that case, whatever I define at the play level
overrides the variables set on the others.
I can even pass in the same information as an extra variable
while running the playbook using the extra-vars option.
Well, in that case, that takes the highest precedence.
The value passed in as an extra variable
to the command line is considered highest priority
and overrides all other values specified
in all other places.
Well, those were just a few of the many ways
you can pass in a variable to an Ansible playbook.
A comprehensive list of the different options
and their precedence is given
in the Ansible documentation
